#### Inference and stationarity

* The monthly log returns of Russell 2000 index vary around zero over time.
  * If we divide up the data into subperiods we would expect each sample mean to be roughly zero.
* Furthermore, expect the recent financial crisis (2007-2009), the log returns range is approximately [-0.2,0.2].
* Statistically, the mean and the variance are constant over time OR time invariant. 
* Put together these to time invariant properties characterise a weakly stationary series.
]
.pull-right[
#### Weak stationarity and prediction

* Weak form stationarity provides a basic framework for prediction.
* For the monthly log returns of the Russell 2000 we can predict with reasonable confidence:
* Future monthly returns $\approx0$ and vary $[-0.2,0.2]$

## Inference and nonstationarity

* Consider quarterly earnings for Carnival Plc.
* If the timespan is divided into subperiods the sample mean and variance for each period show increasing pattern.
* Earnings are **not** weakly stationary.
* There does exist models and methods for modelling such nonstationary series.

# Differencing
.fat[
* Differencing helps to **stabilize the mean**.
* The differenced series is the *change* between each observation in the original series: ${y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}}$.
* The differenced series will have only $T-1$ values since it is not possible to calculate a difference $y_1'$ for the first observation.

.discussion[

* Seasonally differenced series is closer to being stationary.
* Remaining non-stationarity can be removed with further first difference.
* If $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-12}$ denotes seasonally differenced series, then twice-differenced series i
* When both seasonal and first differences are applied
* it makes no difference which is done first the result will be the same.
* If seasonality is strong, we recommend that seasonal differencing be done first because sometimes the resulting series will be stationary and there will be no need for further first difference.
* It is important that if differencing is used, the differences are
interpretable.
]

class: middle

## Interpretation of differencing
.heat[
* first differences are the change between **one observation and the next**;
* seasonal differences are the change between **one year to the next**.

* But taking lag 3 differences for yearly data, for example, results in a model which cannot be sensibly interpreted.

## Non-seasonal ARIMA models

#### Autoregressive models

* When $y_t$ has a statistically significant lag-1 autocorrelation, the lagged value $y_{t-1}$ might be a useful in predicting $y_t$.
* AR(1) model

$$y_{t}= c+\phi_{1}y_{t - 1} + \varepsilon_{t}$$

* where $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise.  
* This is a simple linear regression with **lagged values** of $y_t$ as predictors.

* This simple model is widely used in stochastic volatility when $y_t$ is replaced by its log volatility.

---
class: middle

## Autoregressive models

* More generally, if the  $E(y_{t-1})$ is determined by more than lag-1 we can generalise a AR(1) to an AR(p) model.

.blockquote[
Autoregressive (AR) models:
$$y_{t}= c+\phi_{1}y_{t - 1}+\phi_{2}y_{t - 2} + \dots +\phi_{p}y_{t - p}  + \varepsilon_{t},$$
where $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise.  This is a multiple linear regression with **lagged values** of $y_t$ as predictors.

* If $c=0$ and $d=0$, the long-term forecasts will go to zero.
* If $c=0$ and $d=1$, the long-term forecasts will go to a non-zero constant.
* If $c=0$ and $d=2$, the long-term forecasts will follow a straight line.
* If $c\ne0$ and $d=0$, the long-term forecasts will go to the mean of the data.
* If $c\ne0$ and $d=1$, the long-term forecasts will follow a straight line.
* If $c\ne0$ and $d=2$, the long-term forecasts will follow a quadratic trend.
]
---
class: middle

## Understanding ARIMA models
### Forecast variance and $d$

* The higher the value of $d$, the more rapidly the prediction intervals increase in size.
* For $d=0$, the long-term forecast standard deviation will go to the standard deviation of the historical data.

### Cyclic behaviour
* For cyclic forecasts,  $p\ge2$ and some restrictions on coefficients are required.
* If $p=2$, we need $\phi_1^2+4\phi_2<0$. Then average length of stochastic cycles is

$$(2\pi)/\left[\text{arc cos}(-\phi_1(1-\phi_2)/(4\phi_2))\right].$$

* This formula has important uses in estimation business and economic cycles. (See Example 2.3 in Tsay (2010))

# Estimation and order selection

## Maximum likelihood estimation

- Having identified the model order, we need to estimate the parameters $c,\phi_1,\dots,\phi_p \text{  }\theta_1,\dots,\theta_q$.

* MLE is very similar to least squares estimation obtained by minimizing $\sum_{t-1}^T e_t^2$
* The `Arima()` command allows CLS or MLE estimation.
* Non-linear optimization must be used in either case.
* Different software will give different estimates.

## Partial autocorrelations

.blockquote[
- Partial autocorrelations} measure relationship between $y_{t}$  and  $y_{t - k}$, when the effects of other time lags $1,2, 3, \dots, k - 1$are removed.

- $\alpha_k$= $k$th partial autocorrelation coefficient
- $\alpha_k${equal to the estimate of $b_k$ in regression:

$$y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_k y_{t-k}$$

* Varying number of terms on RHS gives $\alpha_k$ for different values of $k$.
* There are more efficient ways of calculating $\alpha_k$.
* $\alpha_1=\rho_1$
* same critical values of $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$ as for ACF.

## Example: US consumption

```{r usconsumptionacf}
p1 <- ggAcf(uschange[,"Consumption"],main="")
p2 <- ggPacf(uschange[,"Consumption"],main="")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

---
class: middle

## ACF and PACF interpretation

**AR(1)**
$$rho_k =\phi_1^k \text{  for k=1,2,}\dots$$

$$\alpha_1= \phi_1 \alpha_k = 0\text{for k=2,3}\dots$$

So we have an AR(1) model when

* autocorrelations exponentially decay
* there is a single significant partial autocorrelation.

class: middle

## ACF and PACF interpretation
.three-column[
**AR(p)**
  * ACF dies out in an exponential or damped sine-wave manner
  * PACF has all zero spikes beyond the $p$th spike

So we have an AR(p)) model when

  * the ACF is  exponentially decaying or sinusoidal
  * there is a significant spike at lag $p$ in PACF, but none beyond $p$
]

.three-column[
**MA(1)**
$$
\begin{align*}
\rho_1 &= \theta_1 \qquad \rho_k = 0\qquad\text{for k=2,3,...};\\
\alpha_k &= -(-\theta_1)^k
\end{align*}
$$
So we have an MA(1) model when
 * the PACF is  exponentially decaying and
 * there is a single significant spike in ACF
]
.three-column[
**MA(q)**

 * PACF dies out in an exponential or damped sine-wave manner
 * ACF has all zero spikes beyond the $q$th spike

So we have an MA(q) model when

  * there is a significant spike at lag $q$ in ACF, but none beyond $q$

## Information criteria

.blockquote[
**Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC):**

$\text{AIC} = -2 \log(L) + 2(p+q+k+1),$  where $L$ is the likelihood of the data, $k=1$ if $c\ne0$ and $k=0$ if $c=0$]

.blockquote[
**Corrected AIC:** <br>
$\text{AICc} = \text{AIC} + \frac{2(p+q+k+1)(p+q+k+2)}{T-p-q-k-2}.$
]

.blockquote[
**Bayesian Information Criterion:**<br>
$\text{BIC} = \text{AIC} + [\log(T)-2](p+q+k-1).$<br>
Good models are obtained by minimizing either the AIC, AICc or BIC. My preference is to use the AICc.]
